# Note: If a character is followed by a colon (e.g. f:), that option is expected to have an argument.

# Example usage: ./script -v -a -b -f filename

# Using getopts has several advantages over the accepted answer:

# the while condition is a lot more readable and shows what the accepted options are
# cleaner code; no counting the number of parameters and shifting
# you can join options (e.g. -a -b -c â†’ -abc)
# However, a big disadvantage is that it doesn't support long options, only single-character options.
